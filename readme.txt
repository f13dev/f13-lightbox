Add a lightbox for any image within a post or page, includes accessibility features.

== Description ==
Each image wihtin a post or page will become a clickable link with a popup lightbox. This does not use an off the shelf lightbox, instead a custom made 6KB jQuery lightbox helping to reduce overhead on your site without compormising features.

This lightbox is fully acessible via keyboard only input, meets and exceeds WCAG AA contrast requirements, includes keypress navigation (arrow keys to navigate between images and escape to close).

No configuration is required to enable the Lightbox once installed and activated on your WordPress site. Should you wish to exclude an image from the lightbox, simply add the class "no-lightbox" to the image.
